# Custom Load Balancer with Nginx

This project demonstrates how to set up a custom load balancer using Nginx. Load balancing helps distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers, improving performance and high availability.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Nginx: [Download and Install Nginx](http://nginx.org/en/docs/install.html).

## Key Features

This project offers a set of key features for load balancing:

- **Dynamic Load Balancing**: Distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers in real-time.
- **Customizable Load Balancing Policies**: Define your own load balancing policies to meet your specific requirements.
- **High Availability**: Improve the availability of your applications by spreading the load across redundant servers.
- **Health Checking**: Monitor the health of backend servers and automatically remove or add servers based on their status.
- **Session Persistence**: Optionally support session persistence for applications that require it.
- **Security**: Implement security measures to protect your load balancer, including SSL termination, access control, and rate limiting.
